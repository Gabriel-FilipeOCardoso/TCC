# Final paper federated learning
The federated learning project is a real-time DDoS detector;

It's a project that uses Transfer Learning from one instance to another instance of Federated Learning. The Federated Learning uses Deep Learning to detect DDoS attackes from Logs in the IoT infrastructure, so it becomes a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS);

Final paper presented in February 2025.
